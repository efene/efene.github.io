Recommended Libraries
=====================

This is kind of a "Efene Standard Library" composed of recommended modules for
different tasks, we recommend one library per task, if it doesn't satisfy your
needs please help us improve them.

There are two JSON parsing libs since one is pure erlang and the other one is
NIF based.
